This directory contains notebooks used to generate manuscript figures and results. 

* `gg220601_allen_celltype_splitter.ipynb`: taking a set of Allen datasets and splitting it into cell types.
* `gg220606_allen_cellsubtypes_fit.ipynb`: running pipeline on cell type and subtype datasets.
* `gg220602_allen_basic_qc.ipynb`: investigating the differences between sampling parameters inferred for each dataset.
* `gg220602_allen_cellsubtypes_norm.ipynb`: parameteric and nonparameteric noise decomposition comparisons on Allen datasets.
* `gg220606_allen_celltypes_de.ipynb`: analysis of differential expression/regulation on Allen datasets.
 
The `fits` directory contains the figures obtained by running these notebooks. The full search results have been deposited on Zenodo.

In addition, `gg220525_moments.m` is a MATLAB script used to calculate lower moments of the twelve implemented models.
